HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Ezra McCulley

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
Put a pound symbol before the line, #



2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 = 0.6666666666666
2 // 3 = 0
3/2 = 1.5
3//2 = 1
The double forward slash takes off any numbers after a decimal




3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b
  It doesn't work because the c uses lowercase "a" when the variable is an uppercase "A"





4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle

    area_of_rectangle



5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple
account number
account_number
account.number
accountNumber
account#
pi
PI
fred
Fred
GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable
great_big_variable
great.big.variable
2x
x2x
total%
#left

    1Apple, 2x, #left, account number, account.number, account#, great.big.variable, total%,



6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)

    a=5, prediction
   Float, a=15, answer




7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area

    Make it so pi directly equals 3.14




8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42)    42, integer
type(42.0)  42.0, floater
type("C3PO") 'C3PO', string
type(True)  True, bool







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3*(x + y)
a






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
    Because it divides z by 3 before adding
ave = (x+y+z) / 3
